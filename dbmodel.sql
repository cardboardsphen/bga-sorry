-- This is the file where you are describing the database schema of your game
-- Basically, you just have to export from PhpMyAdmin your table structure and copy/paste
-- this export here.
-- Note that the database itself and the standard tables ("global", "stats", "gamelog" and "player") are
-- already created and must not be created here

-- Note: The database schema is created from this file when the game starts. If you modify this file,
--       you have to restart a game to see your changes in database.

-- The check constraint doesn't work because as of 2024-12-28, BGA uses MySql 5.7.44, which doesn't support check constraints.
-- Since it doesn't cause an errors, I'm leaving it in for a future upgrade.
-- It's not critical to anything, but it would be nice to have.
